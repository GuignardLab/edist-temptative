# Python Edit Distances

A library for edit distances in Python 3, based on the
[TCS Alignment Toolbox][1]. If you use this library in academic work, please

# Quickstart Guide

Once the library is compiled (see below), you can use the following command
to compute the standard edit distance between two lists x and y:

```
from edist.sed import sed
sed(x, y, delta)
```

where `delta` is a function that takes two elements of the lists as input
and returns the local distance. Other distances implemented in this library
are:

* the dynamic time warping distance as `edist.dtw.dtw`
* the tree edit distance as `edist.ted.ted`

Please refer to the respective files for more information.

If you wish to compute pairwise edit distances for a whole dataset of lists
or trees, please use the `multiprocess` module. For example, if Xs ans Ys
are lists of lists, then the following command produces a distance matrix
between all elements of Xs and all elements of Ys:

```
from edist.sed import sed
from edist.multiprocess import pairwise_distances

D = pairwise_distances(Xs, Ys, sed, delta)
```

# Building from source

This library is written in [cython][2], such that some sources need to be
compiled to C. Once you have installed [cython][2], execute the following
commands in this directory:

```
python3 cython_setup.py build_ext --inplace
cp *so edist/.
```
